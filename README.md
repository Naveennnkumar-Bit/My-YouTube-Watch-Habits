# YouTube Channel Analysis: My Most Watched Channels  

## Overview  
This project explores my most-watched YouTube channels by analyzing video data and examining trends in content, engagement, and performance. The analysis leverages the YouTube API to gather detailed video metadata, tests common myths about video success, and explores trending topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  


## Introduction  
YouTube is a dominant platform for content creators and viewers. This project aims to analyze video data to uncover patterns and validate common assumptions about what drives video success. Additionally, it explores trending topics through text analysis to understand content preferences better.  

## Dataset  
The dataset will be obtained using the YouTube API and will include:  
- Video metadata (title, duration, tags, upload date, etc.)  
- Engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)  
- Channel-level data (upload frequency, category)  

## Goals of the Project  
1. **Learn to Use the YouTube API**:  
   - Understand the API functionality and retrieve detailed video data.  

2. **Analyze Video Data**:  
   - Test common myths about YouTube video success:  
     - Does the number of likes and comments drive more views?  
     - Does video duration influence interaction and popularity?  
     - Is there a correlation between title length and views?  
     - How many tags do high-performing videos have? What are their common tags?  

3. **Study Upload Trends**:  
   - Determine upload frequency and preferred days for posting across creators.  

4. **Explore Trending Topics**:  
   - Use NLP techniques to identify popular topics covered in video titles.  
   - Generate visualizations like word clouds for topic exploration.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **YouTube API**: For data retrieval.  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud, NLTK, or SpaCy for NLP.
