# **YouTube Channel Analysis: My Most Watched Channels** üì∫üìä  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes my YouTube viewing habits by examining data from my most-watched channels. The analysis involves cleaning and processing YouTube data, exploring trends in engagement, content preferences, and validating common myths about successful videos. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into my personal preferences and broader patterns across the YouTube platform.

## **Skills Demonstrated**  
- **YouTube API**: Fetching video metadata such as views, likes, comments, tags, and upload dates.  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Standardizing inconsistent fields like video titles, durations, and tags.  
- **Text Analysis**: Extracting trending topics from video titles using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
- **Visualization**: Creating insights through interactive and static visualizations.  

---  

## **Aims and Objectives**  

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

- Getting to know YouTube API and how to obtain video data.
- Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on YouTube, for example:
    - Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
    - Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/comments)?
    - Does title length matter for views?
    - How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?
    - Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?
- Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques
    - Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?

## **Comments vs Views & Likes vs Views** üìä  
These scatter plots compare the relationship between the number of comments/likes and the number of views for the videos in the dataset.

## **Distribution of Video Durations** ‚è±Ô∏è  
This histogram shows the distribution of video durations (in hours) for videos with a duration of less than 10,000 seconds. It gives an insight into how long most of the videos are in the dataset.

## **Duration vs Comments & Duration vs Likes** üìä  
These scatter plots compare the relationship between video duration and the number of comments/likes for the videos in the dataset.

## **Word Cloud of Video Titles** üí¨  
This word cloud represents the most frequently used words in video titles across the dataset. The larger the word, the more frequently it appears.
